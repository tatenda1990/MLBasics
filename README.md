# Machine Learning Manual
The repository hosts some scripts for doing routine methods provided in machine learning modules. Whenever I come across a new concept, sometimes I will choose to reinforce it by writing the functionality in my own code, code to do the same thing that I would have just learnt. The first script I did for this was one to determine the constants for a line of best fit using a Gradient Descent method. The intention of scripts in this repository is primarily for improving my Python coding skills all the while reinforcing understanding of whichever new ML concepts I would have just come across, by forcing myself to develop it from the ground up.  

The current scripts in the repository are: 
 1. A Gradient Descent script to calculate constants for the equation that transforms DegC to DegF after being given some DegC and DegF data points.
